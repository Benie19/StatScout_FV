i got the api to work had to hard code it into app, i do not like it. AS i have a deadline it wil do for know 
App works as off 3/12/2024 but does not display the results the way i want it to.needs further ivestigation.

Noticed that api only displays results for the day ,which i am fine with 
Used thunder client to see what results api displays 
Api doesnt display venue but api does display the team logo with the help of chat gpt was able to figure that out

Need to find a new api that can display match information and all that 

So far app works great ,its not the best but it works. 
Need to see if i can expand on this a little bit more,start adding player profile and so on.
